## UX

### Website owner goals

As the owner of the website, I want to create a contribution to the community by giving them another place to share their opinions on board games.
Therefore, I set my website owner goals as followed:
- Within the first two months I want to get 100 registrations of users who created at least one review.
- Within the first six months I want to have reviews of at least 500 different board games on the website.
- Each month I want to have at least 100 persons visiting my website.

### Agile planning

The development of this project was done with an agile approach.

Here is an example of the Kanban board from an early development stage:
![Example of the Kanban board in an early stage]()

The project board can be found here: <>.

#### Milestones
- **1-Preparation:** Make the preparation for the project as for example user stories, set up, deployment etc.
- **2-Create landing page:** Create the first page of the homepage
- **3-Make landing page interactive:** Add search bar, comments, and open review option
- **4-Accounts:** Create option to make and account and log in and out
- **5-Review:** Make it possible to review existing and new board games
- **6-Admin:** Make it possible for the administrator to delete, edit and add content
There is no final deployment milestone, since the deployment started as early as possible to avoid mistakes in early steps.

  - Cloudinary
  - Whitenoise
- A Heroku account must be created.
- Set your GitHub repository to public.
- Create a new app and linked to the correct repo in GitHub while choosing Automatic Deploys for easier handling.
- Create a database with Ci database Maker and link it to the project and the heroku app.
- Hide sensitive information in the env.py with the .gitignore file and update the settings.py file.
- Connect the project and Heroku app with Cloudinary.
- Then deploy
